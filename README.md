Another .NET tool for automatically generating data.

Use the pre-built value generators or write your own to create POCOs with pre-populated data. This is useful for testing purposes, or for generating seed data for development environments. This library aims to provide

1. An easy to understand, and simple DSL for defining how a POCO should be generated.
2. A simple way to extend it by creating your own value generators.
3. Repeatable random test data by allowing you to provide a seeded random source.
4. A substantial set of existing value generators that cover a large range of use cases.
5. A way to compose a definition for a POCO w/ a complex object graph.
